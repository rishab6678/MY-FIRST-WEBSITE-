                Technology has always fascinated me, especially how simple lines of code can turn into powerful applications that people use every day. This curiosity inspired me to step into the world of programming and development.

                Currently, I am pursuing my<BIG> <EM><STRONG>Bachelor of Computer Applications from Pragjyotish College</STRONG></EM></BIG>, where I am building my knowledge in programming, databases, and web technologies. As a fresher, I am actively working on small projects to gain practical experience and strengthen my understanding of real-world development.

                Apart from coding, I also have an interest in graphic designing, which allows me to combine creativity with technical skills. I believe that modern developers should not only understand functionality but also focus on user experience and design.
